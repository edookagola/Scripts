Tracking the time spent on these contributions for reporting and improvement purposes.
Setting up a post-contribution review call to discuss value addition, time spent, and future opportunities for improvement.

I will allocate dedicated time each quarter to work on Wiki and process improvements. I will leverage feedback from senior team members and colleagues to ensure my contributions are valuable and align with team needs.

This goal directly supports the development of our service capabilities by improving knowledge management, streamlining processes, and ensuring documentation remains up-to-date. It aligns with broader team and organizational objectives by fostering continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.

Each contribution will be reviewed within the quarter it was created.
