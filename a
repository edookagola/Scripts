Prefetch Files in Incident Response
Overview
Windows Prefetch files (.pf) are artifacts generated by the operating system to optimize application launch times. When an application is executed, Windows monitors its activity for the first 10 seconds, recording loaded resources and dependencies. This data is then stored in a .pf file located in the C:\Windows\Prefetch directory. These files serve a performance-related purpose but are also valuable foren sic artifacts that can provide execution timestamps and insights into program activity.
Forensic Value of Prefetch Files
Prefetch files can be used in incident response to:
•	Identify program execution, even if the application or malware has been deleted.
•	Extract execution timestamps, including first and last run times, helping analysts build a timeline of events.
•	Support malware analysis, especially in cases where Endpoint Activity Monitoring (EAM) telemetry is unavailable.
•	Determine frequency of execution, which can indicate persistence or repeated execution of suspicious binaries.
•	Correlate execution history with other forensic artifacts, such as ShimCache, AmCache, and Event Logs.
Key Artifacts in a Prefetch File
Prefetch files contain:
•	Executable name and a hash of the path.
•	Run count (how many times the application has been executed).
•	Timestamps (last execution and, in some cases, first execution).
•	List of associated files and DLLs loaded during execution.
Analysis Tools for Prefetch Files
Prefetch files can be parsed using various tools, including:
•	PECMD (Powerful and commonly used for Prefetch analysis).
•	WinPrefetchView (GUI-based tool for quick analysis).
•	Plaso/log2timeline (For timeline creation and correlation).
•	Windows native commands (e.g., PowerShell scripts to list .pf files and timestamps).
Investigative Use Case
When responding to an incident involving a potential malware infection:
1.	Check the Prefetch directory (C:\Windows\Prefetch) for .pf files associated with suspicious executables.
2.	Extract and analyze timestamps to determine when the executable was first and last run.
3.	Correlate with other forensic artifacts (Event Logs, registry entries, $MFT records) to establish an execution timeline.
4.	Use PECMD or similar tools to extract additional details about loaded modules and dependencies.
5.	Document findings and, if necessary, escalate by submitting a MORE/ISI ticket for deeper investigation.
Limitations and Considerations
•	Prefetch must be enabled on the system (default on workstations but often disabled on servers).
•	Prefetch files are not retained indefinitely; Windows retains a limited number (default is 128 for Windows 10+).
•	A .pf file may not exist if the program was run from an external device or a network share.
•	Timestamps in Prefetch files are stored in FILETIME format (UTC) and must be converted appropriately.
PowerShell Script to List Prefetch Files and Timestamps
Get-ChildItem "C:\Windows\Prefetch" | 
Select-Object Name, CreationTime, LastWriteTime | 
Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending
This script lists Prefetch files along with their creation and last modified timestamps, helping analysts quickly identify recent program executions.
